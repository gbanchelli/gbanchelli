- 👋 Hi, I’m Gaia.
- 😄 My pronouns: They/Them, or She/Her if nothing else fits in your language of choice.
- 👀 I’m interested in too many disparate things for someone living 24h days. 
- 🌱 I’m always learning, and currently fixating on python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects, preferably with a strong focus on sustainability and community outreach. 

- ⚡ Random fact: I am a total disaster when I try to accomplish anything left-handed, but somehow managed to compete in the same discipline as both a right-handed and left-handed athlete.
