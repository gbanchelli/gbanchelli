- 👋 Hi, I’m @gbanchelli. You may call me Gaia.
- 👀 I’m interested in too many disparate things for someone living 24h days. 
- 🌱 I’m always learning, and currently fixating on python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new and exciting projects, preferably with a strong focus on sustainability and community outreach. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them or She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being a total disaster when I try to accomplish anything left-handed, I managed to compete in the same discipline as both a right-handed and left-handed athlete.
